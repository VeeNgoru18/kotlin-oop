/*
*
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  What is an abstract  class in Kotlin ?
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
* We create abstract classes to provide a common template for other classes to extend and use
*
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Points to Note
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* 1. We cannot create the object of an abstract class.
* 2. Property and member function of an abstract class are by default non-abstract.
*    If you want to override these in the child class then you need to use open keyword for them.
* 3. If a member function is abstract then it must be implemented in the child class.
*    An abstract member function doesnâ€™t have a body only method signature,
*    the implementation is done in the child class.
